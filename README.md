# Pokedex Pro (Firebase Studio Project)

This project is a modern Pokedex application built with Next.js and React, designed to provide a seamless user experience for exploring Pokémon data.
Our approach leverages Next.js App Router for optimized routing and Server Components for improved performance.
We utilize TypeScript for type safety and maintainability throughout the codebase.
Styling is achieved using Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development, complemented by ShadCN UI for pre-built, customizable components and a consistent theming system.
Client-side state, such as managing favorite Pokémon, is handled efficiently with Zustand.
Data is fetched asynchronously from the PokeAPI using native `fetch`.
The coding style emphasizes functional components, React Hooks, clear naming conventions, and modular component design for reusability.
We prioritize creating responsive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.
Error handling is implemented at both page and component levels to ensure a robust application.
